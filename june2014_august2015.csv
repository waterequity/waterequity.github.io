WCRU actively patrol Los Angeles communities and enforce the City’s Emergency Water Conservation Ordinance. The WCRU investigates reports of wasteful water use and educates violators on the importance of complying with the Water Conservation Ordinance. The WCRU also catches additional violations that were not reported while patrolling neighborhoods. The first official penalty is a citation (warning) letter. Repeat violators are issued monetary fines ranging from $100-$600. Because LADWP has had an emergency water conservation ordinance with outdoor watering restrictions in effect since 2009, LADWP’s customers have been well educated for some time now on ordinance requirements. Therefore, most customers who receive a contact from the WCRU and/or a warning letter respond very well and change their habits immediately. This explains why LADWP has not issued many fines in recent years. ","The LA Mayor and City Council approved amendments to the City’s Emergency Water Conservation Ordinance Plan on June 17, 2015 to include the following new and/or stricter restrictions: no irrigation 48 hours after a rain event; 2 days per week watering schedule; requirements for the use of pool covers and restrictions on filling residential pools; and restrictions on filling decorative fountains or ponds used solely for aesthetic purposes. In December 2014, LADWP started its WaterSmart Pilot Study, which is a behavior efficiency program that aims to educate customers on their water use and the need to conserve through focused outreach through bi-monthly Home Water Reports. These Home Water Reports detail how much water the customer is using, how they compare to homes of similar size and climate, the water reduction required to get to efficient levels, and provide customized water saving tips and rebate recommendations.  LADWP started an AMI pilot program in April 2015 which will ultimately include the installation of around 600 smart meters on targeted customers within the next 18 months.  LADWP started a Water Loss Task Force recently to evaluate various options for improving water loss control and reducing water losses in LADWP’s water distribution system. The report is planned for completion in Fall 2015 and will be presented to management for approval of cost-effective actions. LADWP also has an annual pipe replacement program to reduce leaks in LADWP’s water distribution system.

Using this method, the District has seen no population growth over the past five years. However, our records show that at least three multi-family residential complexes with 453 additional residential units have been developed in the District since 2010. Additionally, the Department of Finance estimates that the population of the city of Montclair, which is served entirely by the District and comprises two-thirds of the District’s retail service area, grew by 1.9% between 2010 and 2014. It is, therefore, more appropriate to calculate the District’s retail service area population based on known, proven, and documented growth rather than by changes in the number of residential connections. Calculation: 2010 US Census population = 53425 + 1.9% = 54460.

MVWD customers are invited to report water being wasted through through dedicated webpage and/or phone number.  ","The MVWD Board of Directors adopted Ordinance 33 on May 12, 2010. Ordinance 33 includes MVWD's water shortage contingency plan, as well as year-round, permanent, and mandatory water use requirements. These permanent requirements, which went into effect upon adoption of Ordinance 33, include all of the water use restrictions in the State Board's emergency regulations, and allow outdoor irrigation only between 8pm-8am for no more than 15 minutes per cycle. On March 12, 2014, the Board adopted Resolution 676-14, which took public action to recognize statewide drought conditions.   In order to assist customers in reducing their outdoor water use, MVWD offers a variety of programs, including free irrigation evaluations, free high-efficiency sprinkler nozzles, free weather-based irrigation controller and nozzle installations, turf removal, and water-efficient device rebates for all customer classes. In response to the drought, MVWD has scheduled four “Drought Response Clinics” over the next four months where customers can receive one-on-one assistance with program signups and rebates, and participate in bilingual gardening mini-classes and demonstration garden tours to learn more about water-efficient plants.   MVWD has sent a direct mail bilingual letter to its customers providing information on the State’s emergency drought regulations, MVWD’s existing mandatory water use requirements, and how they can reduce water use. Included in the mailer is a bilingual flyer on the Drought Response Clinics, specifically targeting customers with limited or no Internet access. MVWD provides recommended seasonal irrigation schedules through customer bills, at the customer service counter, and on our website.      In 2010, MVWD successfully implemented a budget-based tiered water rate for its single-family residential customers. Customers receive an Efficient/Inefficient rating on each bill, as well as their budget (Tier 1 and Tier 2) allocation for the following billing period.   MVWD has already achieved its 20% urban water use reduction requirement as called for under SBX7-7 (2009).

On July 15, 2014, the State Water Resources Control Board approved an emergency regulation to ensure that water suppliers, their customers and state residents increase water conservation in urban settings.  The emergency regulations require that all Californians stop the following activities immediately:     • Washing down driveways and sidewalks • Watering of outdoor landscapes that cause excess runoff • Using a hose to wash a motor vehicle unless the hose is fitted with a shut-off nozzle  • Using potable water in a non-circulating fountain or decorative water feature  In addition, the emergency regulations specifically require that urban water suppliers implement water shortage contingency plans to a level where restrictions on outdoor watering are mandatory.  For Yuba City, that is Stage 3 of the City’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan.    Stage 3 of the City’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan and Municipal Code Section 6-6.19, “Emergency Water Restrictions”, permit lawn watering only as follows:  • EVEN numbered addresses: Wednesdays and Saturdays  • ODD numbered addresses: Thursdays and Sundays  • New lawns may be watered three (3) times each day for the first three (3) weeks after planting provided that notification is given to the City Public Works Department of the new planting either at the time of planting or as soon thereafter as is practicable. • Public agencies and/or commercial/industrial companies using City water to irrigate large turf areas greater than 0.5 acres, shall submit an irrigation schedule for approval by the Public Works Director. This schedule shall provide for a reduction of water use based on a percentage of previous usage. The actual percentage and base year of usage shall be established by the Public Works Director as approved by the City Council and will be in accordance with the severity of the water shortage declared by the City Council. It is recommended that watering take place during the coolest parts of the day in the evening and early morning hours. As part of the City’s continued effort to help water customers comply with these water restrictions, the City has started water patrols which are designed to provide residents with conservation education.  The City’s goal is to raise awareness to the mandatory restrictions, and issue penalties as a last resort.

On July 15, 2014, the State Water Resources Control Board approved an emergency regulation to ensure that water suppliers, their customers and state residents increase water conservation in urban settings.  The emergency regulations require that all Californians stop the following activities immediately:     • Washing down driveways and sidewalks • Watering of outdoor landscapes that cause excess runoff • Using a hose to wash a motor vehicle unless the hose is fitted with a shut-off nozzle  • Using potable water in a non-circulating fountain or decorative water feature  In addition, the emergency regulations specifically require that urban water suppliers implement water shortage contingency plans to a level where restrictions on outdoor watering are mandatory.  For Yuba City, that is Stage 3 of the City’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan.    Stage 3 of the City’s Water Shortage Contingency Plan and Municipal Code Section 6-6.19, “Emergency Water Restrictions”, permit lawn watering only as follows:  • EVEN numbered addresses: Wednesdays and Saturdays  • ODD numbered addresses: Thursdays and Sundays  • New lawns may be watered three (3) times each day for the first three (3) weeks after planting provided that notification is given to the City Public Works Department of the new planting either at the time of planting or as soon thereafter as is practicable. • Public agencies and/or commercial/industrial companies using City water to irrigate large turf areas greater than 0.5 acres, shall submit an irrigation schedule for approval by the Public Works Director. This schedule shall provide for a reduction of water use based on a percentage of previous usage. The actual percentage and base year of usage shall be established by the Public Works Director as approved by the City Council and will be in accordance with the severity of the water shortage declared by the City Council. It is recommended that watering take place during the coolest parts of the day in the evening and early morning hours. As part of the City’s continued effort to help water customers comply with these water restrictions, the City has started water patrols which are designed to provide residents with conservation education.  The City’s goal is to raise awareness to the mandatory restrictions, and issue penalties as a last resort.  For those that choose not to comply with the mandatory restrictions, the following penalty schedule will apply:  1st violation: Written warning 2nd violation:  $ 50.00 surcharge* 3rd violation:  $100.00 surcharge* 4+ violations: $250.00 surcharge* per violation *Surcharges shall appear on the next monthly water billing  The Public Works Department provides complimentary water audits and will assist with adjusting sprinkler timers upon request.

RCWD service area includes about 18,000 acres of agricultural and ranch lands, primarily vineyards, avocado, and citrus trees. Agricultural water use from July 2014 through March 2015 ranges from 12% to 31% of the District's potable water use. Additionally, the District maintains Ag/Domestic meters where one meter serves both a home and agricultural land on a parcel. UPDATE 1: As was indicated in all of the original monthly reports submitted to SWB, the District included a significant amount of agricultural demand in its calculation of total residential demand. After further consideration, RCWD has determined that it is not appropriate to include this agricultural demand in the calculation of residential demand since the demand represents water that is produced for commercial agricultural uses and not for urban uses. Furthermore, the District has looked more closely at the population of its service area by compiling data that is more up-to-date than that which was used for the original reports, and has arrived at a more accurate determination of population. Therefore, RCWD has made revisions to each previously submitted report using updated residential demand and population data.

For June 2014 through February 2015, Ag/Domestic averaged 15% of total residential use. In 2011, we analyzed the amount that agriculture represent in Ag/Domestic accounts, excluded that amount, and it lowered the GPCD by approximately 12%, a substantial change. UPDATE 1: As was indicated in all of the original monthly reports submitted to SWB, the District included a significant amount of agricultural demand in its calculation of total residential demand. After further consideration, RCWD has determined that it is not appropriate to include this agricultural demand in the calculation of residential demand since the demand represents water that is produced for commercial agricultural uses and not for urban uses. Furthermore, the District has looked more closely at the population of its service area by compiling data that is more up-to-date than that which was used for the original reports, and has arrived at a more accurate determination of population. Therefore, RCWD has made revisions to each previously submitted report using updated residential demand and population data.

In the emergency response to the incident it is sometimes difficult to measure the exact quantity of water which went to fighting the blaze. A very conservative, but fact based estimate showed us that at least .0445 million gallons produced by BBLDWP left our service area and went to fighting the fire outside of our service area. The estimate is as follows. Forestry fire trucks using 300 gallons per fill filled up at least 100 time for a total 30,000 gallons. Emergency operations reported at least 8,000 gallons for the air ops resources and a local businessman with a water truck assisted operations using 6,500 gallons; reaching a cumulative 44,500 gallons of water. This amount has been deducted from our total production. In addition, after a discussion with our General Manager on June 16 we were instructed to consider Camp Oakes as wholesale water and deduct it from our total potable water production. Camp Oakes used 2 CCF/units of water prior to the Lake Fire and that amount was deducted from our commercial consumption (as a wholesale commercial account). Camp Oakes reportedly used an additional 21 CCF/units to support fire fighting operations. These 23 CCF/units were deducted from our total production.

In order to complete the Report in a timely fashion the City used a conservative percentage of 85% as our residential customer base. Staff has since completed a comprehensive review of our meters and determined that our actual residential percentage is 78%. The comprehensive review included site visits, verification with internal records and county property tax records. The software now includes the data needed to pull reports by category on a monthly basis. Therefore, the City of Glendora is using the accurate residential figure for our June and subsequent reports.   Second, our early reporting used the City of Glendora 2010 Urban Water Management Plan for our population base figure of 48,200. The June report has been updated to standardize the population based on the California Department of Finance estimates.  As a result, the population for the City of Glendora has been updated to 51,463 pursuant to the May 1, 2015 press release from the California Department of Finance.

Our current population estimate is 21,441 based on studies done at California State University, Sacramento. Our former population # gave us a GPCD of 229.6 whereas the new estimate gives us 179.9. This would qualify us for 32%. 2. We do not rely on imported water and our groundwater supply recharged naturally in 2015.
